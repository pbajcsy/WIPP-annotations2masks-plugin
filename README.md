# WIPP-annotations2masks-plugin

This plugin converts image annotations extracted from a JSON file generated by WIPP using web deep zoom toolkit (WDZT) and creates a mask image based on unique color, shape, or text 


## Command line interface parameters


Implemented in **class:** *MaskFromAnnotations*, **method:**  *CMDlaunch*

- @param **inputJSONFileFolder** - input folder with JSON files
- @param **uniqueType** - integer defining whether the masks are created based on label (1), color (2) or shape (3)
- @param **combineAllUnique** - boolean flag whether to create one mask with all unique types of color/label/shape (value = true) or one mask per of color/label/shape unique type (value = false)

**Note:** if the spatial annotations for two different colors/labels/shapes overlap spatially then combineAllUnique=true leads to a pixel assignment based on the order of annotations 

 
- @param **inputRawFileFolder** - input folder with raw TIFF files
- @param **outFileFolder** - output folder for the generated masks

- @return boolean depending on the success

**Note:** The method assumes that the JSON files and RawImageFiles in their appropriate folders have matching names except for their suffixes.
